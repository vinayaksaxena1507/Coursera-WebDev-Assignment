                <h3 class="sectionTitleBox">The Plan</h3>
                <p class="sectionParagraph">
                    17 major languages, 844 dialectsThe languages of India belong to several language families, the major ones being the
                    Indo-European languages Indo-Aryan (spoken by 72% of Indians) and the Dravidian languages (spoken by 25% of Indians).
                    Other languages spoken in India belong to the Austro-Asiatic, Tibeto-Burman, and a few minor language families and
                    isolates.
                    
                    The principal official language of the Republic of India is Standard Hindi, while English is the secondary official
                    language.The constitution of India states that "The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari
                    script."Neither the Constitution of India nor Indian law specifies a national language, a position supported by a High
                    Court ruling.However, languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian constitution are sometimes referred to,
                    without legal standing, as the national languages of India.
